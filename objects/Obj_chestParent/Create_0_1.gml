/// Contains data for all chests
event_inherited();
//In order to make a master list of chests, I will need to take in the 
//ID's made by Gamemaker by default and then assign item values to give to the 
//Player. No lookup table will be needed as the ID's of each chest are unique to the
//Instance and should never be changed unless that instance is deleted.
